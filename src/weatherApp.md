# step-by-step explanation of how to build a React weather app:

Set up a new React project:

<!-- Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create the project.
Run the following command to create a new React project: npx create-react-app weather-app
Change to the project directory: cd weather-app
Install additional dependencies:

In the project directory, install the following dependencies: npm install axios react-icons
Create a Weather component:

Inside the src folder, create a new folder called components.
Inside the components folder, create a new file called Weather.js.
Open the Weather.js file and add the following code: ```jsx import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'; import axios from 'axios'; import { FaTemperatureHigh } from 'react-icons/fa';

const Weather = () => { const [weather, setWeather] = useState(null); -->

<!-- useEffect(() => { const fetchWeather = async () => { try { const response = await axios.get( 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=YOUR_CITY_NAME&appid=YOUR_API_KEY' ); setWeather(response.data); } catch (error) { console.error(error); } };

fetchWeather();

}, []);
if (!weather) { return <div>Loading...</div>; }

return ( <div> <h2>{weather.name}</h2> <div> <FaTemperatureHigh /> <span>{weather.main.temp}Â°C</span> </div> </div> ); }; -->

<!-- export default Weather; ```

Replace the content in the App.js file:

Open the src folder and open the App.js file.
Remove the existing code and replace it with the following code: ```jsx import React from 'react'; import Weather from './components/Weather'; -->

<!-- const App = () => { return ( <div className="App"> <h1>Weather App</h1> <Weather /> </div> ); };

export default App; ``` -->

Obtain an API key:d66afa513fae5be604bb17bc74d128e9

Go to the OpenWeatherMap website (https://openweathermap.org/) and create an account if you don't have one.
After logging in, go to your account dashboard and generate an API key.
Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' in the Weather.js file with your actual API key.
Replace 'YOUR_CITY_NAME' with the desired city name in the Weather.js file.

Start the development server:

In the terminal, run the following command: npm start
This will start the development server and open the app in your browser.
That's it! You've built a basic React weather app. The app will display the name of the city and the current temperature using data from the OpenWeatherMap API. Feel free to customize the app's styling and add more features as needed.
